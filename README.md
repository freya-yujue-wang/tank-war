"Tank Wars", it mimics the classical NES game ‘Battle City’, the player controls a human tank to destroy the enemy tanks, which enter the playfield from different directions of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the human tank. To make the game more interesting, some obstacles was added to the playfield. If the missiles encounter the obstacles, they will change directions. The player can move the human tank in eight directions instead of four. The human tank can launch super missiles which fire in eight directions simultaneously. A health bar and a medkit to increase the health was added for the human tank.
